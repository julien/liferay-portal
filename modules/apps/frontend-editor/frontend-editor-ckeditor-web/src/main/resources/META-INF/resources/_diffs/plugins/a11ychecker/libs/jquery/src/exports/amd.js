	// Register as a named AMD module, since jQuery can be concatenated with other
	// files that may use define, but not via a proper concatenation script that
	// understands anonymous AMD modules. A named AMD is safest and most robust
	// way to register. Lowercase jquery is used because AMD module names are
	// derived from file names, and jQuery is normally delivered in a lowercase
	// file name. Do this after creating the global so that if an AMD module wants
	// to call noConflict to hide this version of jQuery, it will work.

	// Note that for maximum portability, libraries that are not jQuery should
	// declare themselves as anonymous modules, and avoid setting a global if an
	// AMD loader is present. jQuery is a special case. For more information, see
	// https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/wiki/Updating-existing-libraries#wiki-anon
